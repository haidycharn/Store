.. create database ..example "store" with user credentials

.. to open the project
.. http://localhost/store
.. store is the project name

.. by default it will open the installation page
.. this step is to migrate database tables into created database
.. will ask you to insert database name, username, password and host
.. in case of running in localhost, it is better to insert your local ip with port used
.. this step will create 3 tables (product, category and user)

.. signing up and login functionality are handled

.. i created a product page but it is missing the remaining functionality due to shortage in time
